I've dedicated my professional journey to harmonizing innovation, ecology, and the human experience. From my advocacy for Heliogenesis — a vision where technology and nature sing in tandem — to my passion for crafting the perfect all-in-one sports drink with le melo, I believe in the power of synergy.

My recent venture, the Anima Mundi Newsletter, is a testament to my commitment to delving deep into the nuances of our collective human experience. Through it, I'm synthesizing my thoughts and feelings on topics pivotal to well-rounded human existence, both on the individual and collective fronts. ---> www.animamundi.substack.com

As I navigate the evolving terrain of civilization's future, my mission remains consistent: to build, share, and inspire solutions that cater to holistic well-being and sustainable progress.

Building Wagenbach Industries for the next Civilisation....
